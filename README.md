Credit Risk Analysis Report
An overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to create and evaluate the accuracy of a data model that predicts the credity worthiness of potential borrowers from peer-to-peer lending services
The results: Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the 
precisioBalanced Accuracy Score: 99% --> this means that when taking into account the sensitivity (recall and/or true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) of the model, the balanced prediction accuracy was 99%
Precision Score: 85% --> This means 85% of predicted positives were correct
Recall Score: 91% --> this means that the model was 91% precise in measuring true positive values our of all positive predictions made

A summary: Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you donâ€™t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.

The machine learning model has demonstrated a relatively high level of accuracy, precision, and recall in predicting credit risk. This suggests that the model is effective in identifying potential credit risks, which can help the company make informed decisions about lending.

It's important to note that while the model's performance is promising, it's not perfect. There is a 15% chance that the model may incorrectly assess credit risk, and a 25% chance that it may miss high-risk cases. recommend the use of this model due to its overall high performance. It's important to remember that no model can predict with 100% accuracy, and this model's scores are quite high compared to industry standards. The model can be a valuable tool for the company, helping to reduce credit risk and improve profitability. However, it should be used in conjunction with other risk assessment tools and expert judgment to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of credit risk.
